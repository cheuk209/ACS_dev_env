# Common Kubernetes Resources in a Promotion Pipeline in OpenShift

- **Pods**: Run the containers for each Task and Step.
- **ConfigMaps**: Store configuration data used by the Tasks.
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive information like credentials.
- **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**: Provide persistent storage for Workspaces.
- **ServiceAccounts**: Define permissions for accessing resources.
- **Deployments**: Manage the deployment of applications.
- **Services**: Expose applications running on a set of Pods.
- **Ingress/Routes**: Manage external access to the services.

# Example Promotion Pipeline Flow

1. **Source Code Checkout**: Clone the source code repository.
2. **Build**: Compile the code and build the container image.
3. **Test**: Run unit tests and integration tests.
4. **Scan**: Perform security scans on the built image.
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the application to a staging environment.
6. **Approval**: Manual approval step for promotion to production.
7. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy the application to the production environment.


To create a Proof of Concept (PoC) for each of the Tekton Pipelines hierarchy components in your OpenShift cluster, you can follow these ideas:

Tasks:

Create a simple Task that prints "Hello, World!".
Define a Task that clones a Git repository and prints the latest commit message.
Pipelines:

Create a Pipeline that consists of multiple Tasks, such as cloning a repository, building a Docker image, and pushing it to a registry.
Define a Pipeline that runs a series of Tasks to perform a CI/CD workflow, including build, test, and deploy.
PipelineRuns:

Create a PipelineRun to execute the Pipeline defined above.
Pass different parameters to the PipelineRun to see how it affects the execution.
TaskRuns:
 
Create a TaskRun to execute a single Task. 


# Better breakdown
Certainly! Here is a comprehensive breakdown and explanation of the Tekton Pipelines hierarchy, including the most important components of each type of object:

### 1. Step
**Steps** are the smallest unit of execution within a Task. Each step runs a command or script in a container.

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the step within the Task.
- **Image**: The container image to use for the step.
- **Script**: The script or command to execute within the container.
- **Args**: Arguments to pass to the command.
- **Env**: Environment variables to set within the container.
- **VolumeMounts**: Volumes to mount into the container.

Example:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: step1
    image: ubuntu
    script: |
      echo "This is step 1"
  - name: step2
    image: ubuntu
    script: |
      echo "This is step 2"
```

### 2. Task
**Tasks** are a collection of steps that are executed sequentially. Tasks are used to perform specific operations.

- **Metadata**: Contains the name and labels for the Task.
- **Steps**: A list of steps to execute within the Task.
- **Params**: Parameters that can be passed to the Task.
- **Workspaces**: Shared storage between Tasks.
- **Resources**: Inputs and outputs for Tasks (e.g., Git repositories, images).

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: example-task
spec:
  steps:
    - name: step1
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        echo "This is step 1"
    - name: step2
      image: ubuntu
      script: |
        echo "This is step 2"
```

### 3. Pipeline
**Pipelines** are a collection of Tasks that define a complete workflow. Pipelines specify the order in which Tasks are executed and how data flows between them.

- **Metadata**: Contains the name and labels for the Pipeline.
- **Tasks**: A list of Tasks to execute within the Pipeline.
- **Params**: Parameters that can be passed to the Pipeline.
- **Workspaces**: Shared storage across the Pipeline.
- **Resources**: Inputs and outputs for the Pipeline.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: example-pipeline
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      taskRef:
        name: example-task
    - name: task2
      taskRef:
        name: example-task
      runAfter:
        - task1
```

### 4. PipelineRun
**PipelineRuns** are used to execute a Pipeline. They reference a specific Pipeline and provide the runtime configuration, such as parameters and workspaces.

- **Metadata**: Contains the name and labels for the PipelineRun.
- **PipelineRef**: Reference to the Pipeline to be executed.
- **Params**: Parameters passed to the Pipeline.
- **Workspaces**: Storage used during the Pipeline execution.
- **Status**: Current status of the PipelineRun (e.g., running, succeeded, failed).

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: example-pipeline-run
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: example-pipeline
  params:
    - name: param1
      value: value1
  workspaces:
    - name: shared-workspace
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: pvc-name
```

### Summary
- **Steps**: The smallest unit of execution within a Task, representing a single command or script.
- **Tasks**: A collection of steps that are executed sequentially to perform specific operations.
- **Pipelines**: A collection of Tasks that define a complete workflow, specifying the order of execution and data flow.
- **PipelineRuns**: Used to execute a Pipeline, providing runtime configuration such as parameters and workspaces.

This hierarchy allows you to build complex CI/CD workflows by composing and orchestrating smaller, reusable units of work.

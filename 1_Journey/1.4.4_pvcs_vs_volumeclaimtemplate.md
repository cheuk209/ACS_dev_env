# VolumeClaimTemplate vs Persistent Volume Claim in OpenShift

## Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
- A **PVC** is a pre-existing storage resource that must be created before running the pipeline
- It persists across multiple pipeline runs
- Useful when you want to:
  - Share data between different pipeline runs
  - Keep artifacts for longer periods
  - Reuse the same storage space

````yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
````

## VolumeClaimTemplate
- A **VolumeClaimTemplate** creates a new PVC dynamically for each pipeline run
- The PVC is automatically created when the pipeline starts
- It is typically deleted when the pipeline run completes
- Useful when you want to:
  - Isolate storage between pipeline runs
  - Avoid managing PVC lifecycle manually
  - Ensure clean workspace for each run

````yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  name: daily-info-run
spec:
  workspaces:
    - name: output
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi
````

## Key Differences

| Feature | PVC | VolumeClaimTemplate |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Lifetime | Persistent across runs | Temporary (per run) |
| Creation | Manual, beforehand | Automatic, at runtime |
| Deletion | Manual | Automatic |
| Data Sharing | Can share between runs | Isolated per run |
| Management | Manual lifecycle | Automated lifecycle |
| Use Case | Long-term storage, shared data | Isolated, temporary storage |

## Best Practices
1. Use **VolumeClaimTemplate** when:
   - Each pipeline run needs a clean workspace
   - You want automated storage lifecycle
   - Running parallel pipeline instances

2. Use **PVC** when:
   - Sharing data between pipeline runs
   - Storing artifacts long-term
   - Reusing the same workspace

We'll create a simple but illustrative pipeline that:

- Runs your hello-world task first
- Then runs a second task that fetches the weather
- Finally combines the outputs in a third task

This will demonstrate task orchestration, parallel execution, and data passing between tasks.

## Task Orchestration
Run multiple tasks, each task will run in its own pod.

## Learn Task Execution Control
We can impose task execution control to ensure tasks execute in the agreed order. If not set, tasks will run in parallel.

## Passing of Data
Ensure the output from one task can be passed to the final task, which will be the summary task. The output from one task becomes input to another.

### Best Way to Share Data

#### 1. Results and Parameters
**How it works:**

- A task produces a small piece of text output as a "Result".
- Another task consumes this output as a "Parameter".

```yaml
# Task 1 produces a result
results:
    - name: commit-id
        description: "The git commit ID"

# Task 2 consumes the result as a parameter
params:
    - name: commit
        value: $(tasks.git-clone.results.commit-id)
```

**Best for:**

- Small pieces of data (limited to 4KB)
- Configuration values, flags, or identifiers
- Command outputs, version numbers, etc.

**Limitations:**

- Size limit (4KB)
- Text only (no binary data)

#### 2. Workspaces (PVCs)
**How it works:**

- Define a shared workspace at the Pipeline level.
- Map it to each Task that needs access.
- Provide a PVC as the actual storage.

#### 3. EmptyDir for Same-Node Tasks
**How it works:**

- Use Kubernetes EmptyDir volumes.
- Only works if tasks run on the same node.

**Best for:**

- Temporary data sharing within an affinity-pinned pipeline.
- When workspaces are overkill.

**Limitations:**

- Tasks must run on the same node.
- Data is ephemeral.

### Choosing the Right Method

- For small text data: Use Results and Parameters.
- For files and large data: Use Workspaces.
- For configuration data: Use ConfigMaps.
- For secure data: Use Secrets.
- For event-driven workflows: Use CloudEvents.


```yaml
# Task 1 produces a result
results:
    - name: commit-id
        description: "The git commit ID"

# Task 2 consumes the result as a parameter
params:
    - name: commit
        value: $(tasks.git-clone.results.commit-id)

so this method, is results a file? a file path, why do we need to output things to $results.name.path ??
In the context of task automation tools like Tekton, the term `results` refers to a mechanism for capturing and storing the output of a task step. Specifically, `results` is not a file itself but rather a predefined path where the output of a task step is saved. Each result is associated with a specific file path, denoted by placeholders like `$(results.name.path)`.

When you see `$(results.name.path)`, it indicates that the output of a particular task step should be written to a file at the location specified by this path. This is useful for several reasons:

1. **Persistence**: By saving the output to a file, the result can be persisted beyond the lifetime of the task step. This means that other steps in the pipeline or subsequent tasks can access and use this output.

2. **Inter-task Communication**: In a pipeline, different tasks may need to share data. Writing output to a file at a known path allows other tasks to read this data, facilitating communication between tasks.

3. **Standardization**: Using a standardized path for results ensures consistency and predictability in how outputs are handled. This makes it easier to design and debug pipelines.

In summary, `$(results.name.path)` is a placeholder for a file path where the output of a task step is saved. This approach allows for the persistence and sharing of data between different parts of a pipeline, ensuring smooth and efficient task execution.


both approaches actually work, but the $(results.weather.path) approach is preferred for several reasons:

## Success
Ok my pipelineRun was finally successful. However, clearly I need more understanding on how data is passed. Explore alternatives. Make sure you understand. √ç

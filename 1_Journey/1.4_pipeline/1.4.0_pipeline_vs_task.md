So a task can have multiple steps in it, and a pipeline can have multiple tasks in it. 

So help me understand, what is the difference between the two? Seeing as you can sequentially go through a bunch of steps for both objects

You're right that both Tasks and Pipelines involve sequences of operations, but they serve different purposes in the Tekton architecture:
Task vs Pipeline

Tasks:

    A Task is the basic building block - it defines a series of Steps that run sequentially in a single Pod
    All Steps in a Task share the same context, volumes, and workspace
    Steps **run in the same Pod**, albeit in different containers, using different images, making Tasks suitable for tightly coupled operations
    Steps are isolated in their own containers but can share data through **workspaces**
    A Task runs as a single Pod with multiple containers (one per Step)

Pipelines:

    A Pipeline is a higher-level construct that orchestrates multiple Tasks
    Tasks in a Pipeline can run in parallel or sequentially (based on defined dependencies)
    Each Task runs in its own separate Pod
    Tasks can exchange data through PipelineResources or Workspaces
    A Pipeline provides a way to model complex workflows with proper separation of concerns

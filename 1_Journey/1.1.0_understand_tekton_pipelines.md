# Tekton Pipelines Hierarchy

## Tasks

- **Steps**: Sequential commands executed within a Task.
- **Workspaces**: Shared storage between Tasks.
- **Resources**: Inputs and outputs for Tasks (e.g., Git repositories, images).

## Pipelines

- **Tasks**: A series of Tasks executed in a defined order.
- **Params**: Parameters passed to Tasks.
- **Workspaces**: Shared storage across the Pipeline.

## PipelineRuns

- **PipelineRef**: Reference to the Pipeline to be executed.
- **Params**: Parameters passed to the Pipeline.
- **Workspaces**: Storage used during the Pipeline execution.
- **Status**: Current status of the PipelineRun (e.g., running, succeeded, failed).

## TaskRuns

- **TaskRef**: Reference to the Task to be executed.
- **Params**: Parameters passed to the Task.
- **Workspaces**: Storage used during the Task execution.
- **Status**: Current status of the TaskRun.

# Common Kubernetes Resources in a Promotion Pipeline in OpenShift

- **Pods**: Run the containers for each Task and Step.
- **ConfigMaps**: Store configuration data used by the Tasks.
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive information like credentials.
- **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**: Provide persistent storage for Workspaces.
- **ServiceAccounts**: Define permissions for accessing resources.
- **Deployments**: Manage the deployment of applications.
- **Services**: Expose applications running on a set of Pods.
- **Ingress/Routes**: Manage external access to the services.

# Example Promotion Pipeline Flow

1. **Source Code Checkout**: Clone the source code repository.
2. **Build**: Compile the code and build the container image.
3. **Test**: Run unit tests and integration tests.
4. **Scan**: Perform security scans on the built image.
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy the application to a staging environment.
6. **Approval**: Manual approval step for promotion to production.
7. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy the application to the production environment.


To create a Proof of Concept (PoC) for each of the Tekton Pipelines hierarchy components in your OpenShift cluster, you can follow these ideas:

Tasks:

Create a simple Task that prints "Hello, World!".
Define a Task that clones a Git repository and prints the latest commit message.
Pipelines:

Create a Pipeline that consists of multiple Tasks, such as cloning a repository, building a Docker image, and pushing it to a registry.
Define a Pipeline that runs a series of Tasks to perform a CI/CD workflow, including build, test, and deploy.
PipelineRuns:

Create a PipelineRun to execute the Pipeline defined above.
Pass different parameters to the PipelineRun to see how it affects the execution.
TaskRuns:

Create a TaskRun to execute a single Task.
Pass parameters to

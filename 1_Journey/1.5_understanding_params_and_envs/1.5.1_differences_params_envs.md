In the context of Tekton, **`params`** and **`env`** serve different purposes, even though they can both be used to pass values into a task. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

---

### **1. `params`**
- **Purpose**: Parameters (`params`) are used to define inputs to a Tekton task. They are explicitly declared in the task definition and can be passed dynamically when the task is executed.
- **Scope**: Parameters are scoped to the task and are not directly exposed as environment variables unless explicitly mapped.
- **Usage**:
  - Parameters are referenced using `$(params.<name>)` syntax.
  - They are typically used for dynamic values that need to be passed into the task at runtime (e.g., image names, action types, etc.).

**Example**:
```yaml
params:
  - name: action_type
    type: string
    default: check
```
In the script, you can reference it as:
```bash
echo "Action type: $(params.action_type)"
```

### **2. `env`**
- **Purpose**: Environment variables (`env`) are used to pass values into the container running the task step. These are standard environment variables available to the script or command running inside the container.
- **Scope**: Environment variables are scoped to the specific step in which they are defined.
- **Usage**:
  - Environment variables are defined under the `env` section of a step.
  - They are typically used for values that need to be accessed as environment variables inside the container (e.g., API tokens, configuration values).

**Example**:
```yaml
env:
  - name: ROX_API_TOKEN
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: $(params.acs_secret)
        key: rox_api_token
```
In the script, you can reference it as:
```bash
echo "API Token: $ROX_API_TOKEN"
```

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                | `params`                                      | `env`                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Input to the task                            | Environment variables for the container   |
| **Scope**              | Task-wide                                    | Step-specific                             |
| **Access Syntax**      | `$(params.<name>)`                           | `$<ENV_VAR_NAME>`                         |
| **Dynamic Values**     | Passed dynamically at runtime                | Typically static or derived from secrets  |
| **Use Case**           | Task configuration (e.g., image names, flags)| Container runtime values (e.g., tokens)   |

---

### **How They Work Together**
In your example, `params` are used to define dynamic inputs like `action_type`, `image`, and `output_format`. These are then mapped to environment variables (`env`) for use inside the container.

For example:
```yaml
env:
  - name: OUTPUT
    value: $(params.output_format)
```
Here, the `params.output_format` parameter is mapped to the `OUTPUT` environment variable, making it accessible as `$OUTPUT` inside the container.

---

### **When to Use Each**
- Use **`params`** when you need to pass dynamic values into the task that may change between task runs.
- Use **`env`** when you need to expose values as environment variables for the containerized script or command to use.

```

Why do we use the image: curlimages?

The provided YAML snippet specifies the container image to be used for a particular step in a Tekton Task. The image defined here is `curlimages/curl:latest`. This image is based on the `curl` utility, which is a command-line tool used for transferring data with URLs.

By specifying `curlimages/curl:latest`, the task ensures that it uses the latest version of the `curl` image available. This image includes the `curl` command pre-installed, allowing the task to perform HTTP requests and interact with web APIs directly from within the container.

Using a specific image like `curlimages/curl` is beneficial when you need to perform network operations, such as fetching data from an API, downloading files, or testing endpoints. It encapsulates the necessary tools and dependencies within the container, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment for executing the task.

ok motivational-quote-task installed. How do I inspect it? See the quotes etc?

ðŸ¦¶ Steps

 âˆ™ quote


 Yes, you can retrieve the quote directly by running a `TaskRun` and then viewing its logs. Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Create a TaskRun**: Define a TaskRun YAML that references the `motivational-quote-task`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: TaskRun
    metadata:
      name: motivational-quote-task-run
    spec:
      taskRef:
        name: motivational-quote-task
    ```

2. **Apply the TaskRun**: Save the above YAML to a file (e.g., `motivational-quote-task-run.yaml`) and apply it using `kubectl`.

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f motivational-quote-task-run.yaml
    ```

3. **View the logs**: Use the `tkn` CLI to view the logs of the TaskRun and see the quote.

    ```sh
    tkn taskrun logs motivational-quote-task-run
    ```

This will show you the output of the `curl` command executed within the Task, which includes the motivational quote fetched from the API.

Here is a summary of the commands:

1. Create the TaskRun:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f motivational-quote-task-run.yaml
    ```

2. View the logs to see the quote:
    ```sh
    tkn taskrun logs motivational-quote-task-run
    ```

By following these steps, you can directly retrieve and view the motivational quote after running the TaskRun.

OK so the image I used had no jq, so I have had to applied the task again. But now do I have to create a new TaskRun?

To run the existing TaskRun against the updated Task, you can delete the previous TaskRun and create a new one. Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Delete the existing TaskRun**:
    ```sh
    kubectl delete taskrun motivational-quote-task-run
    ```

2. **Recreate the TaskRun**:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: TaskRun
    metadata:
      name: motivational-quote-task-run
    spec:
      taskRef:
        name: motivational-quote-task
    ```

    Save this YAML to a file (e.g., `motivational-quote-task-run.yaml`) and apply it:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f motivational-quote-task-run.yaml
    ```

3. **View the logs**:
    ```sh
    tkn taskrun logs motivational-quote-task-run
    ```

By following these steps, the new TaskRun will use the updated Task definition, and you should be able to see the output of the quote in the logs.

When do you use kubectl and not tkn?

Yes, when you apply a TaskRun with `kubectl apply -f taskrun.yaml` or `oc apply -f taskrun.yaml`, Tekton creates one or more pods to execute the task.

Here's what happens:

1. When you create a TaskRun, the Tekton controller notices it and initializes the execution
2. The controller creates a pod that contains:
   - An init container for each step in your Task
   - A main container that manages the execution flow
   - Volumes for workspaces and passing data between steps

3. Each step in your Task runs sequentially within this pod, with each step executing in its own container

You can observe this process by:

```bash
# List TaskRuns
kubectl get taskruns
# or
tkn taskrun list

# See the pod created for a specific TaskRun
kubectl get pods -l tekton.dev/taskRun=<taskrun-name>

# Watch the logs of the TaskRun
tkn taskrun logs <taskrun-name> -f
# or
kubectl logs -l tekton.dev/taskRun=<taskrun-name> -f
```

Each step's logs are captured and can be viewed separately. The TaskRun itself tracks the overall status of the execution, including start time, completion time, and whether it succeeded or failed.

The pod will be automatically cleaned up based on your Tekton configuration, but the TaskRun object remains so you can inspect the results later.


I woud like to run a task that echos "hello world" and then we will use output the motivational quote. Updated the quotes api tasks, then applied again.
